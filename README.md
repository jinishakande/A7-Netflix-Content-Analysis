**Netflix Content Analysis**

Netflix is known to be one of the best internet media and entertainment streaming companies. Over the years, it has faced several challenges and overcome a shift in demographics, changing viewership styles and choices. 

Netflix’s content library and its recommendations engine play a big role in influencing the content consumed by people worldwide. Research from Netflix shares that over 80% of the content watched on their platform came from their recommendations engine. 

While Netflix has enjoyed a long period of success as the sole pioneer of the internet media streaming industry, **things have changed**. There is fierce competition in the market such as `Disney+`, `Amazon Prime Video`, `HBO Max`, and others. 

In addition, Netflix is facing trouble in holding on to the content that people watch and enjoy as they are licensed under the other streaming platforms.

Our dataset was captured using a combination of tools and methods; scraping, API calls, and manual validation. Using these techniques, the author of the original dataset, Shivam Bansal, was able to capture information on a myriad of topics, namely on Netflix shows, movie titles, directors, casts, countries, release dates, ratings, and more. 

In total, our main dataset has `12` columns and `8807` rows.
